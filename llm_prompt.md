**Objective:** Update an existing Eleventy project (based on the Aigora template) to incorporate new content and assets, ensuring the final output is beautiful, impactful, and perfectly aligned with the Aigora brand voice and visual style. You will be provided with details of the Aigora template's structure and styling (`llm_info.md`), the new content (`content.md`), and potentially other assets.

**Your Task:**

Generate *only the necessary files and their full content* to update the Aigora Eleventy template project. This means you should identify which existing files need modification and which new files need to be added. Do NOT output a list of instructions or a diff; provide the complete content for each file that needs to be created or changed.

**Input Provided to You (Conceptually):**

1.  **`llm_info.md`**: A document detailing the Aigora 11ty template's architecture. This includes:
    *   Key configuration files (`package.json`, `.eleventy.js`, `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`).
    *   Layout and global styling information (`_includes/layout.njk`, `src/css/style.css`), including the dual light/dark theme mechanism and CSS custom properties.
    *   Content structure examples (`src/index.njk`, `src/about.njk`).
    *   Static asset management details.
    *   The Aigora design system tokens (colors, fonts, spacing) defined in `tailwind.config.js` and implemented in `style.css`.
2.  **`content.md`**: A document containing the new content to be integrated. This may be a mix of Markdown, HTML, Mermaid diagrams, and other textual material. It might define a single page, multiple pages, or modifications to existing site sections.
3.  **Additional Assets Folder (Optional)**: This folder may contain images or other static files referenced in `content.md`. Assume these assets should be placed in the appropriate directory within the Aigora template structure (likely `assets/images/` or a similar new subdirectory you define if necessary, and ensure they are correctly referenced in the content).

**Aigora Brand Voice and Style Mandate (Crucial!):**

You MUST adhere strictly to the Aigora Brand Voice. Refer to the following guidelines in all aspects of your output, from textual content to component selection and structural decisions:

*   **Tone**: Authoritative, thoughtful, instructional, quietly bold.
*   **Voice**: Calmly confident, systems-first, Promethean-with-a-heart.
*   **Vibe**: Elegant, future-facing, deeply human.
*   **We are NOT**: Trendy, casual, corporate, fluffy, disruptive-for-the-sake-of-it.
*   **We ARE**: Teachers, builders, translators between tech and human experience.
*   **Essence**: Aigora builds intelligent systems that empower sensory and consumer science teams to thrive in the AI era—by modernizing workflows, amplifying insight, and helping humans and machines collaborate meaningfully.

*   **Voice Pillars**:
    1.  **Authoritative**: Clear statements, direct CTAs, confident headlines. Avoid soft qualifiers.
    2.  **Educational**: Teach by showing. Clarity over cleverness. Use structured explanations, modular metaphors. Avoid jargon/AI hype.
    3.  **Empowering**: Position user/client as future leader. Second-person phrasing, future-focused verbs.
    4.  **Elegant**: Intentionality in every element. Crisp spacing, polished fonts, smooth color transitions. Avoid overdesign, noisy UI.

*   **Tone Settings by Page Type (Apply if `content.md` implies distinct page types):**
    *   **Homepage-like content**: Inspirational + Strategic. Vision, outcomes, brief, emotionally resonant.
    *   **About-like content**: Earnest + Intelligent. Origin story, philosophical why, human grounding.
    *   **Product/Service-like content**: Instructive + Clear. Diagram systems. Answer "what?" and "how does it help?"
    *   **Use Case-like content**: Strategic + Relatable. Reflect real-world problems; show transformation.

*   **Keyword Lexicon**:
    *   **Prioritize**: Insight, structure, build, systems, workflows, training, human-AI collaboration, infrastructure, transformation, science of experience.
    *   **Avoid**: Disrupt, scale fast, hack, tools, dashboards, plug-and-play, AI will replace, no-code magic, instant results, quick win, sentiment, vibes, engagement.

*   **Signature Lines/Messaging Anchors (Integrate naturally where appropriate):**
    *   "Life is lived through the senses."
    *   "The future of research isn’t faster surveys. It’s living systems."
    *   "We don’t deliver reports. We build capability."
    *   "Don’t fall behind. Lead."
    *   "Work smarter. Learn faster. Grow insight."

*   **CTAs (Use Aigora's preferred phrasing):**
    *   E.g., "Talk to a systems strategist" (NOT "Schedule a call").
    *   E.g., "Explore your next research system" (NOT "See our software").

*   **Visual & Structural Application Notes (Guided by `llm_info.md` and Aigora style):**
    *   **Fonts**: Use Cormorant SC Semibold (H1/H2, generous spacing) and Roboto Regular (body, loose line height) as defined in the Aigora template.
    *   **Colors**: Strictly use the Aigora theme colors from `tailwind.config.js` and as implemented with CSS variables in `style.css`. Pay attention to semantic color roles:
        *   `#0A0A0A` (or theme equivalent like `var(--color-base-content)` for dark text): Hero headlines, dominant body.
        *   `#5FB96A` (or `var(--color-primary)`): Primary accent (buttons, active state).
        *   `#A986C4` (or `var(--color-secondary)`): Subtle tech/system cue.
        *   `#DB2955` (or `var(--color-error)`): Sharp emphasis or emotional pop.
    *   **Layout**: Maintain elegance and clarity. Use appropriate spacing. Ensure responsiveness.
    *   **Components**: Select and style components (buttons, cards, sections, etc.) from the Aigora design system (as detailed in `llm_info.md` and seen in examples) that best fit the content and the brand voice. For instance, use the Aigora-styled buttons, cards with `shadow-aigora`, etc.
    *   **Avoid**: Small gray text, emoji, excessive exclamation points.

**Process Guidance:**

1.  **Understand the New Content (`content.md`)**: Analyze its structure, meaning, and any explicit or implicit page divisions or asset references.
2.  **Cross-Reference with Aigora Template (`llm_info.md`)**: Determine how this new content best fits into the Aigora site structure. Will it be new pages? Modifications to existing page structures shown in `src/index.njk` or `src/about.njk`?
3.  **Apply Aigora Brand Voice**: Infuse the content with the Aigora voice. This might involve rephrasing, choosing specific terminology from the lexicon, and structuring information according to the voice pillars. If `content.md` is already perfectly aligned, ensure its presentation maintains this.
4.  **Determine File Changes**:
    *   **New Pages**: If `content.md` describes new pages, create new `.njk` files in the `src/` directory. These files should use the standard Aigora front matter (e.g., `layout: layout.njk`, `title: "Appropriate Title"`). Populate them with the new content, styled using Tailwind utility classes, Aigora theme classes (e.g., `bg-base-100`, `text-primary`), and custom Aigora utilities (e.g., `font-header`, `shadow-aigora`) as defined in `llm_info.md`.
    *   **Modifications to Existing Structures**: If `content.md` implies changes to, for example, sections on the homepage (mirroring `src/index.njk`), you should provide the *complete, updated content* for `src/index.njk`.
    *   **CSS**: Only suggest changes or additions to `src/css/style.css` if absolutely necessary for new structural elements or styles that cannot be achieved with existing Aigora utilities and are critical for the new content. Prioritize using the existing system.
    *   **JavaScript/Layout**: Do not modify `_includes/layout.njk` or other core JavaScript unless the new content introduces a fundamental requirement that cannot be met otherwise (highly unlikely).
    *   **Configuration**: Do not modify `.eleventy.js`, `tailwind.config.js`, or `package.json` unless the new content structure or assets *absolutely require* it (e.g., a new passthrough copy for a new type of asset).
5.  **Asset Placement**: If new image assets are provided, assume they are placed in `assets/images/` (or a relevant new subdirectory you can name). Ensure all image paths in your generated HTML content are correct (e.g., `/assets/images/your-image.png`).
6.  **Mermaid Diagrams**: If `content.md` includes Mermaid diagram definitions, ensure they are enclosed in appropriate Markdown code blocks for potential processing by an Eleventy plugin (e.g., ```mermaid
...
```). The Aigora template itself might not have a Mermaid plugin pre-configured, but structure the content correctly for one.

**Output Format:**

For each file that needs to be created or modified, provide:

1.  The **full file path** (e.g., `src/new-page.njk` or `src/css/style.css`).
2.  The **complete content** of that file.

**Example (Conceptual Output Structure):**

```

**Final Check**: Before outputting, review your generated files to ensure they are internally consistent, correctly reference assets, and fully embody the Aigora brand voice and visual style as detailed. Ensure all text, including headings and CTAs, aligns with the Aigora Keyword Lexicon and Tone Settings.
